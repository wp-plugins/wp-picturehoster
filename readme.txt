Any known Bugs?
Yeah, the mimetyp isnt read out properly atm, will fix that in the next version.

The files are in the wp-picturehoster directory in the wp-content folder

Where can I find the files in WordPress?
You can have a look in the mediapool in the WordPress backend.

Are there any template functions?
Yes, there is a function 'wpp_picturehoster()' which is basicly the same as the shortcode.

What will be the next version?
I plan to do an extra management page beside the normal mediapool.
Also there gonna be a plugin page with some settings, i.e. expiration date and so on.
